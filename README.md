# The Great Sample Repository
There isn't any specific goal here, it's just where I'm going to upload some minor projects when and if I remember. These are often meant to solve very niche problems, but who knows, one of them might end up solving your very niche problem as well.

## Projects
**[ FlipDNS ]**
Simplify the disablement of company-managed DNS by employees when those servers have unexpected problems. Client requested specific compatibility with Ubuntu 22.04 LTS and provided a detailed spec. May update for better user interaction (and interactive notifications) when [GitLab: GNOME/libnotify](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libnotify) >=0.7.10 is supported on 22.04, or if the client (or anybody interested) has a use for this on >=22.10 where the necessary version of libnotify is already included.

**[ Licensing ]**
Some of these projects may have been completed under contract, in which case the client has authorized their release here. All projects here fall under the MIT License **unless** otherwise noted within its working directory.
